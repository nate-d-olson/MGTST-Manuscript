		  high-throughput marker-gene sequencing data without
		  resorting to the customary construction of molecular
		  operational taxonomic units (OTUs): clusters of sequencing
		  reads that differ by less than a fixed dissimilarity
		  threshold. New methods control errors sufficiently such
		  that amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) can be resolved
		  exactly, down to the level of single-nucleotide differences
		  over the sequenced gene region. The benefits of finer
		  resolution are immediately apparent, and arguments for ASV
		  methods have focused on their improved resolution. Less
		  obvious, but we believe more important, are the broad
		  benefits that derive from the status of ASVs as consistent
		  labels with intrinsic biological meaning identified
		  independently from a reference database. Here we discuss
		  how these features grant ASVs the combined advantages of
		  closed-reference OTUs-including computational costs that
		  scale linearly with study size, simple merging between
		  independently processed data sets, and forward
		  prediction-and of de novo OTUs-including accurate
		  measurement of diversity and applicability to communities
		  lacking deep coverage in reference databases. We argue that
		  the improvements in reusability, reproducibility and
		  comprehensiveness are sufficiently great that ASVs should
		  replace OTUs as the standard unit of marker-gene analysis
		  and reporting.",

  abstract	= "Obtaining human population level estimates of the

		  understanding outbreaks and ameliorating such threats to
		  public health. Estimates are difficult to obtain due to
		  logistic and financial constraints, but citizen science
		  initiatives like that of the American Gut Project (AGP)
		  represent a potential source of information concerning
		  enteric pathogens. With an emphasis on genera Listeria and
		  Salmonella, we sought to document the prevalence of those
		  two taxa within the AGP samples. The results provided by
		  AGP suggest a surprising 14\% and 2\% of samples contained
		  Salmonella and Listeria, respectively. However, a
		  reanalysis of those AGP sequences described here indicated
		  that results depend greatly on the algorithm for assigning
		  taxonomy and differences persisted across both a range of
		  parameter settings and different reference databases (i.e.,
		  Greengenes and HITdb). These results are perhaps to be
		  expected given that AGP sequenced the V4 region of 16S rRNA
		  gene, which may not provide good resolution at the lower
		  taxonomic levels (e.g., species), but it was surprising how
		  often methods differ in classifying reads-even at higher
		  taxonomic ranks (e.g., family). This highlights the
		  misleading conclusions that can be reached when relying on
		  a single method that is not a gold standard; this is the
		  essence of Segal's Law: an individual with one watch knows
		  what time it is but an individual with two is never sure.
		  Our results point to the need for an appropriate molecular
		  marker for the taxonomic resolution of interest, and calls
		  for the development of more conservative classification
		  methods that are fit for purpose. Thus, with 16S rRNA gene
		  datasets, one must be cautious regarding the detection of
		  taxonomic groups of public health interest (e.g., culture
		  independent identification of foodborne pathogens or taxa

		  evolution as reliable markers for the taxonomic

		  Restricted by current sequencing techniques, the massive
		  sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons encompassing the full
		  length of genes is not yet feasible. Thus, the selection of
		  the most efficient hypervariable regions for phylogenetic
		  analysis and taxonomic classification is still debated. In
		  the present study, several bioinformatics tools were
		  integrated to build an in silico pipeline to evaluate the
		  phylogenetic sensitivity of the hypervariable regions
		  compared with the corresponding full-length sequences.
		  RESULTS: The correlation of seven sub-regions was inferred
		  from the geodesic distance, a parameter that is applied to
		  quantitatively compare the topology of different
		  phylogenetic trees constructed using the sequences from
		  different sub-regions. The relationship between different
		  sub-regions based on the geodesic distance indicated that
		  V4-V6 were the most reliable regions for representing the

		  built environment, the International Space Station (ISS).
		  This ISS sampling involved the collection and microbial
		  analysis (via 16S rDNA PCR) of 15 surfaces sampled by swabs
		  onboard the ISS. This sampling was a component of Project
		  MERCCURI (Microbial Ecology Research Combining Citizen and
		  University Researchers on ISS). Learning more about the

		  sites sampled were designed to be analogous to samples

		  Sequencing of the 16S rDNA genes amplified from DNA

		  Conclusions While significantly different from homes on

		  more similar to home surfaces than to the human microbiome

	abstract = {PCR amplification of 16S rRNA genes is a critical, yet under appreciated step in the generation of sequence data to describe the taxonomic composition of microbial communities. Numerous factors in the design of PCR can impact the sequencing error rate, the abundance of chimeric sequences, and the degree to which the fragments in the product represent their abundance in the original sample (i.e. bias). We compared the performance of high fidelity polymerases and varying number of rounds of amplification when amplifying a mock community and human stool samples. Although it was impossible to derive specific recommendations, we did observe general trends. Namely, using a polymerase with the highest possible fidelity and minimizing the number of rounds of PCR reduced the sequencing error rate, fraction of chimeric sequences, and bias. Evidence of bias at the sequence level was subtle and could not be ascribed to the fragments{\textquoteright} fraction of bases that were guanines or cytosines. When analyzing mock community data, the amount that the community deviated from the expected composition increased with rounds of PCR. This bias was inconsistent for human stool samples. Overall the results underscore the difficulty of comparing sequence data that are generated by different PCR protocols. However, the results indicate that the variation in human stool samples is generally larger than that introduced by the choice of polymerase or number of rounds of PCR.Importance A steep decline in sequencing costs drove an explosion in studies characterizing microbial communities from diverse environments. Although a significant amount of effort has gone into understanding the error profiles of DNA sequencers, little has been done to understand the downstream effects of the PCR amplification protocol. We quantified the effects of the choice of polymerase and number of PCR cycles on the quality of downstream data. We found that these choices can have a profound impact on the way that a microbial community is represented in the sequence data. The effects are relatively small compared to the variation in human stool samples, however, care should be taken to use polymerases with the highest possible fidelity and to minimize the number of rounds of PCR. These results also underscore that it is not possible to directly compare sequence data generated under different PCR conditions.},
