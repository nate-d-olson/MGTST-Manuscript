\end{figure}

\paragraph*{Volumetric Mixing Validation}
Titration series volumetric mixing was validated using qPCR to quantify exogenous
DNA (ERCC plasmids) spiked into the POST samples prior to mixing.
The expectation is that the ERCC plasmid copy number will change at a rate consistent
with the change in proportion of POST along the titration series
(Fig. \ref{fig:countExperimentalDesign}B and \ref{fig:titrationValidation}).
For our \(log_2\) two-sample-titration mixture design the expected slope of the
regression line between titration factor and Ct is 1, corresponding to a
doubling in template DNA every PCR cycle. The qPCR assay
standard curves had a high level of precision with \(R^2\) values close
to 1 and amplification efficiencies between 0.84 and 0.9 for all
standard curves indicating the assays were suitable for validating the
titration series volumetric mixing (Table \ref{tab:erccTable}). The qPCR assays targeting the
ERCCs spiked into the POST samples had \(R^2\) values and slope
estimates close to 1 (Table \ref{tab:erccTable}). Slope estimates less
than one were attributed to assay standard curve efficiency less than 1
(Table \ref{tab:erccTable}). When considering the
quantitative limitations of the qPCR assay these results confirm that
the unmixed samples were volumetrically mixed according to the
two-sample titration mixture design.

The linear model slope was still significantly different from 0 when the
outlier was included.}
\end{figure}

\paragraph*{Prokaryotic DNA Proportion Validation}
Observed changes in prokaryotic DNA concentration across titrations
indicate the proportion of prokaryotic DNA from the unmixed PRE and POST
samples in a titration is inconsistent with the mixture design (Fig.
\ref{fig:bacPlot}). A qPCR assay targeting the 16S rRNA gene was used to
quantify the concentration of prokaryotic DNA in the titrations. If the
proportion of prokaryotic DNA is the same between PRE and POST samples
the slope of the concentration estimates across the two-sample titration
would be 0. For subjects where the proportion of prokaryotic DNA is
higher in the PRE samples, the slope will be negative, and positive when
the proportion is higher for POST samples. The slope estimates are
significantly different from 0 for all subjects excluding E01JH0011
(Fig. \ref{fig:bacPlot}). These results indicate that the proportion of
prokaryotic DNA is lower in POST when compared to the PRE samples for
E01JH0004 and E01JH0017 and higher for E01JH0016 and E01JH0038.

Our titration validation results identified differences in the
proportion of prokaryotic DNA in PRE and POST samples (Fig. \ref{fig:bacPlot}).
Therefore our expected values used in measurement assessment need to account
for differences in the proportion of prokaryotic DNA from unmixed samples.
To account for differences in prokaryotic DNA proportion we inferred
the proportion of POST sample prokaryotic DNA in a titration, \(\theta\), using
the 16S rRNA sequencing data (Fig. \ref{fig:thetaHat}). Overall the relationship
between the inferred and mixture design \(\theta\) values were
consistent across pipelines but not subject whereas the \(\theta\)
estimate 95\% CI varied by both subject and pipeline. For study subjects
E01JH0004, E01JH0011, and E01JH0016 the inferred and mixture design
\(\theta\) values were in agreement, in contrast to study subjects
E01JH0017 and E01JH0038. For E01JH0017 the inferred values were
consistently less than the mixture design values. For E01JH0038
the inferred values were consistently greater than the mixture design
values. These results were consistent with the qPCR prokaryotic DNA
concentration results with significantly positive slopes for E01JH0004
and E01JH0016 and significantly negative slope for E01JH0038 (Fig.
\ref{fig:bacPlot}).
