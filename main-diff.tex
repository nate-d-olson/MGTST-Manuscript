\section*{Background}

marker-gene-surveys, is a commonly used method for characterizing
microbial communities, microbiomes}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{is commonly used to characterize
microbial communities}\DIFaddend . The 16S rRNA marker-gene-survey
measurement process includes molecular \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{(e.g.~PCR and sequencing) and
computational steps (e.g., sequence clustering) \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{Goodrich2014}}%DIFAUXCMD
.
Molecular steps are used }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{steps }\DIFaddend to selectively target and sequence the 16S rRNA
gene from prokaryotic organisms within a sample \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{. The computational steps }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and
computational steps \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{Goodrich2014} }%DIFAUXCMD
computational steps
}\DIFaddend convert the raw sequence data into a \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{matrix with feature (e.g.,
operational taxonomic units) }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{count table of feature }\DIFaddend relative abundance values
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, feature
abundance relative to all other features, for each sample
}\DIFdelend \cite{Goodrich2014}. Both molecular and computational measurement
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{process steps }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{processes }\DIFaddend contribute to the overall measurement bias and dispersion
\cite{Amore2016, Goodrich2014, brooks2015truth}. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Proper measurement
method evaluation allows for }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The need for datasets characterizing complex microbial communities with
some degree ``ground truth'' has emerged in order to properly characterize the accuracy of }\DIFaddend the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{characterization of how individual
steps impact the measurement processes as a whole and determine where to focus efforts for improving the measurement process.

datasets and methods are needed to evaluate the }\DIFdelend 16S rRNA
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{marker-gene-survey measurement process. 
A sample or dataset with ``ground truth'' is needed to characterize measurement process accuracy.
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{marker-gene-survey measurement process.
}

\DIFadd{Diverse bioinformatic pipelines used to generate count tables produce data with diverse characteristics.
For example the commonly used QIIME, Mothur, and
DADA2 pipelines produce feature sets and count tables with different characteristics. 
Mothur uses }\emph{\DIFadd{de novo}} \DIFadd{clustering for feature
inference \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{westcott2017opticlust, schloss2009introducing}}%DIFAUXCMD
.
Pairwise distances used in clustering are calculated from a multiple
sequence alignment. Quality filtered paired-end reads are merged
into contigs, then aligned to a reference multiple
sequence alignment, followed by the removal of uninformative positions.
As a result the feature set representative sequences are shorter than the input amplicons. 
For the QIIME open-reference clustering pipeline merged paired-end reads are first assigned to reference cluster
centers \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{Rideout2014, Caporaso2010}}%DIFAUXCMD
. 
Next, unassigned reads are clustered }\emph{\DIFadd{de novo}}\DIFadd{. 
Unlike Mothur, the QIIME pipeline clustering method uses pairwise sequence distances calculated from pairwise sequence alignments. 
As a result, the QIIME pairwise distances are calculated using the full amplicon sequence, 
whereas Mothur pairwise distances are calculated using multiple sequence alignment with only informative positions.
The DADA2 pipeline uses a probability model and maximization expectation algorithm for feature inference \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{callahan2016dada2}}%DIFAUXCMD
. 
Unlike distance-based clustering methods employed by the Mothur and QIIME pipelines, 
DADA2 parameters determine if low abundance sequences are grouped with a higher abundance sequence.
}

\DIFaddend Numerous studies have evaluated quantitative and qualitative
characteristics of the 16S rRNA measurement process using mock
communities, simulated data, and environmental samples.

}\DIFaddend \cite{Kopylova2014}. The higher than expected number of features is
often attributed to sequencing and PCR artifacts as well as reagent

A notable exception \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{to
this is mock community benchmarking studies evaluating sequencing

Results from relative abundance estimates using mock communities generated from
mixtures of single organism\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{'s }\DIFaddend DNA have shown taxonomic specific effects
where individual taxa are under or over represented in a sample. For

compared to Gram-positive bacteria\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, and are thus likely over represented

Mismatches in the primer binding sites are also responsible for
taxonomic specific biases
\cite{brooks2015truth, klindworth2012evaluation, Gohl2016}.
Additionally, taxon specific biases due to sequence template properties
such as GC content, secondary structure, and gene flanking regions have
been observed \cite{Pinto2012, Hansen1998, Gohl2016}.

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Using }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{However, using }\DIFaddend simulated data to assess log fold-change

Quantitative and qualitative assessment can also be performed using
sequence data generated from mixtures of environmental samples. While
simulated data and mock communities are useful in evaluating and
benchmarking new methods\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend one needs to consider that methods optimized
for mock communities and simulated data are not necessarily optimized

Data from \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{environmental samples, which are real samples, are }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{real environmental samples are }\DIFaddend often used

However, without \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{an expected value to compare to}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{expected values for use in assessment}\DIFaddend , only measurement

\DIFaddFL{To assure the mixture dataset is suitable for use in our assessment framework, we first validated the titration series and raw sequence data.
The mixture dataset had sufficient sample coverage, reads per sample, and read quality for use in our assessment framework. 
The number of reads per sample and distribution of base quality scores by position was consistent across subjects (Fig. S5).
There were \(8.9548\times 10^{4}\) (152,267 - 3,195) sequences per sample, median and
range. Average base quality score was greater than 30 over the length of the amplicon when considering both forward and reverse reads (Fig. S5B).
}\DIFaddendFL 

\DIFaddbeginFL \DIFaddFL{Additionally, we characterized subject specific differences to inform the interpretation of our assessment results.
No subject specific differences in base quality score were observed (Fig. S5). However, average read depth was greater for E01JH004 compared to the other individuals (Fig. S5).
Community composition differences between PRE and POST samples and individuals was characterized using alpha and beta diversity (Fig. S6). 
Overall alpha diversity was higher for POST except for E01JH0011, 
though differences in diversity between PRE and POST varied by individual. 
Based on the beta diversity the community composition within individuals differed between the PRE and POST samples. Note that assessment metrics defined above and results reported below are based on within subject comparisons.
}

\DIFaddFL{To validate the two-sample titration assessment dataset,
we evaluated two assumptions about the titrations:
(1) The samples were mixed volumetrically in a
\(log_2\) dilution series according to the mixture design.
(2) The unmixed PRE and POST samples
have the same proportion of prokaryotic DNA.
To validate the sample volumetric mixing exogenous DNA (ERCC plasmids) were spiked into the
unmixed samples before mixing and quantified
using qPCR (Fig. S1B). The stool samples used to generate the mixtures have both eukaryotic (primarily human) DNA and
prokaryotic DNA. If the proportion of prokaryotic DNA differs between
the unmixed samples, then the amount of DNA from the unmixed samples in
a titration targeted by 16S rRNA gene sequencing is not consistent with
the mixture design. We quantified the proportion of prokaryotic DNA in the unmixed samples using a qPCR assay targeting the 16S rRNA gene (Fig. S1C).
}

\DIFaddFL{Our assessment dataset validation results indicated that the samples were volumetrically mixed according to the mixture design (Table S1) but prokaryotic DNA proportion varied across the titration series (Fig. S2). 
To account for deviations from the mixture design due to differences in the proportion of prokaryotic DNA in the unmixed samples, we estimated the proportion of POST in each titration using the 16S rRNA sequencing data (Fig. S3) and 
the estimated POST proportions were used in our assessment metric calculations. 
See Supplemental Material for the assessment dataset validation methods and results.

for 300 bp paired-end reads, compared to other commonly used amplicons
\cite{kozich2013development, Walters2016-lf}. The high drop-out rate is
due to low basecall accuracy at the ends of the reads especially the

QIIME and DADA2 pipelines were similarly sparse (the fraction of zero

\DIFdel{Titration series volumetric mixing was validated by quantifying ERCC
plasmids spiked into the POST samples using qPCR. The qPCR assay
standard curves had a high level of precision with \(R^2\) values close
to 1 and amplification efficiencies between 0.84 and 0.9 for all
standard curves indicating the assays were suitable for validating the
titration series volumetric mixing (Table \ref{tab:erccTable}). For our
\(log_2\) two-sample-titration mixture design the expected slope of the
regression line between titration factor and Ct is 1, corresponding to a
doubling in template DNA every PCR cycle. The qPCR assays targeting the
ERCCs spiked into the POST samples had \(R^2\) values and slope
estimates close to 1 (Table \ref{tab:erccTable}). Slope estimates less
than one were attributed to assay standard curve efficiency less than 1
(Table \ref{tab:erccTable}). ERCCs spiked into PRE samples were not used
to validate volumetric mixing as PRE sample proportion differences were
too small for qPCR quantification. The expected \(C_t\) difference for
the entire range of PRE concentrations in only 1. When considering the
quantitative limitations of the qPCR assay these results confirm that
the unmixed samples were volumetrically mixed according to the
two-sample titration mixture design.

\DIFadd{Based on the artifactual feature proportions and count table sparsity, 
DADA2 artifactual features are likely due to false negative features, whereas the Mothur and QIIME high sparsity values were attributed to false positive features. 
Based on the observed sparsity levels it is unlikely that any of the pipelines successfully filtered out a
majority of the sequencing artifacts. Both unmixed- and titration-specific
features that can and cannot be explained by sampling alone contribute
to sparsity and the differences in the artifactual feature proportion

titration as well as feature-level bias and variance.
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The PRE and POST
estimated relative abundance and inferred \(\theta\) values were used to
calculate titration and relative abundance error rates. Relative
abundance error rate is defined as \(|exp - obs|/exp\), where \(exp\)
and \(obs\) is the expected and observed relative abundance. To control
for biases in feature inference, the three pipelines were compared to an
unclustered dataset. The unclustered count table was generated using the
40,000 most abundant features from Mothur's initial preprocessing (see
Methods for details). Unclustered pipeline \(\theta\) estimates were
used to calculate the error rates for all pipelines to prevent
over-fitting. }\DIFdelend Only features observed in all PRE and POST PCR replicates
and PRE and POST specific features were included in the analysis (Table \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\ref{tab:relAbuErrorTbl}). PRE and POST specific features were defined
as present in all four of the PRE or POST PCR replicates, respectively,
but none of the PCR replicates for the other unmixed samples. There is
lower confidence in PRE or POST feature relative abundance when the
feature is not observed all 4 PCR replicates, therefore these features
were not included in the analysis. }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{S3). }\DIFaddend Overall, agreement between inferred
and observed relative abundance was high for all individuals and
bioinformatic pipelines (Fig. \ref{fig:relAbuError}A). The error rate
distribution was similarly consistent across pipelines, including long
tails (Fig. \ref{fig:relAbuError}B)\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{.
}\DIFaddend 

To assess quantitative accuracy \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{across pipelines}\DIFaddend , we compared the feature-level relative
abundance error rate bias \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{(median error rate, Fig.
\ref{fig:relAbuErrorMetrics}A) and variance
(\(RCOV=(IQR)/|median|\)

}\DIFaddend using mixed effects models. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{To control for subject specific differences,

}\DIFaddend Large bias and variance metric values were
observed for all pipelines (Table \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\ref{tab:relAbuErrorTbl}).
Features
with large bias and variance metrics, \(1.5\times IQR\) from the median ,
were deemed outliers.
To prevent these outlier features from biasing the
comparison they were not used to fit the mixed effects model. Multiple
comparisons test (Tukey) was used to test for significant differences in
feature-level bias and variance between pipelines.
A one-sided
alternative hypothesis was used to determine which pipelines had smaller
feature-level error rate}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{S3).
Feature-level relative abundance error rate bias (median error rate, Fig.
\ref{fig:relAbuErrorMetrics}A) was significantly different between
pipeline, but no statistically significant differences were observed
for the variance metric, (\(RCOV=(IQR)/|median|\), Fig.

and QIIME feature-level \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{bias }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{biases }\DIFaddend were all significantly different from
each other (\(p < 1\times 10^{-8}\)). DADA2 had the lowest mean
feature-level bias (0.2), followed by Mothur (0.28), with QIIME having the highest bias
(0.33) (\ref{fig:relAbuErrorMetrics}B). Large variance metric values
were observed for all individuals and pipelines (Table \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\ref{tab:relAbuErrorTbl}}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{S3}\DIFaddend ). The feature-level variance was not

%DIF > % Move to discussion?
The agreement between log-fold change estimates and expected values were
individual specific and consistent across pipelines (Fig.
\ref{fig:logFCerror}A). The individual specific effect was attributed to
the fact that unlike relative abundance assessment\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend the inferred
\(\theta\) values were not used to calculate expected values. Inferred
\(\theta\) values were not used to calculate the expected values because
all of the titrations and the \(\theta\) estimates for the higher
titrations were \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{included and they were }\DIFdelend not monotonically decreasing\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{and
therefore }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{.
Using the inferred \(\theta\) }\DIFaddend resulted in unrealistic expected log fold-change values, e.g.,
negative log-fold changes for PRE specific features. The log-fold change
estimates and expected values were consistent across pipelines with one
notable exception\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{. For }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{: for subject }\DIFaddend E01JH0011\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend the Mothur log fold-change estimates
were more consistent with expected values than the other pipelines.
However, as \(\theta\) was not corrected for differences in the
proportion of prokaryotic DNA between the unmixed PRE and POST samples\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{,
}\DIFaddend it cannot be said whether Mothur's performance was better than the other
pipelines.


The log fold-change error distribution was consistent across pipelines
(Fig. \ref{fig:logFCerror}B). There was a long tail of high error
features in the error distribution for all pipelines and individuals.
The log fold-change estimates responsible for the long tail could not be
attributed to specific titration comparisons. Additionally, we compared
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{log-fold change }\DIFdelend error distributions for log-fold change estimates using
different normalization methods. Error rate distributions, including the
long tails, were consistent across normalization methods. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Furthermore,
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Seeing
}\DIFaddend as the long tail was observed for the unclustered data as well, the
log-fold change estimates contributing to the long tail are likely due
to a bias associated with the molecular \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{laboratory }\DIFdelend portion of the
measurement process and not the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{bioinformatic pipelines}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{computational portion}\DIFaddend . Exploratory
analysis of the relationship between the log fold-change estimates and
expected values for individual features indicated that the long tails
were attributed to feature specific performance.

Feature-level log fold-change bias and variance metrics were used to
compare pipeline performance (Fig. \ref{fig:logFCerror}). Similar to
relative abundance\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend feature-level bias and variance metrics are defined
as the \(1 - slope\) and \(R^2\) for linear models of the estimated and
expected log fold-change for individual features and all titration
comparisons. For the bias metric, \(1 - slope\), the desired value is 0
(i.e., log fold-change estimate = log fold-change expected), with
negative values indicating the log-fold change was consistently
underestimated and positive values consistently overestimated. The
linear model \(R^2\) value was used to characterize the feature-level
log fold-change variance as it indicates consistency between log
fold-change estimates and expected values across titration comparisons.
To compare bias and variance metrics across pipelines\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend mixed-effects
models were used. The log fold-change bias and variance metrics were not
significantly different between pipelines (Bias: F = 0, 2.51, p = 0.99,
0.08, \ref{fig:logFCerror}B, Variance: F = 47.39, 0.23, p = 0, 0.8, Fig.
\ref{fig:logFCerror}C).
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{We also evaluated whether poor feature-level
metrics could be attributed to specific clades for taxonomic groups.
Similar to the relative abundance estimate, while a phylogenetic signal
was detected for both the bias and variance metrics, no specific
taxonomic groups or phylogenetic clades that performed poorly were
identified. }\DIFdelend

\subsubsection*{Count Table Assessment Demonstration}
\DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD <

\DIFdelend We demonstrated our \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{novel assessment approach by evaluating }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{assessment framework on }\DIFaddend count tables generated \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{using different }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{by three commonly used }\DIFaddend bioinformatic pipelines, QIIME, Mothur, and DADA2.
The \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Mothur pipeline uses }\emph{\DIFdel{de novo}} %DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdel{clustering for feature
inference \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{westcott2017opticlust, schloss2009introducing}}%DIFAUXCMD
.
Pairwise distances used in clustering are calculated using a multiple
sequence alignment.
The quality filtered paired-end reads are merged
into contigs.
The pipeline then aligns contigs to a reference multiple
sequence alignment and removes uninformative positions in the multiple
sequence alignment. 
The QIIME pipeline uses open-reference clustering
where merged paired-end reads are first assigned to reference cluster
centers \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{Rideout2014, Caporaso2010}}%DIFAUXCMD
. Next QIIME clusters
unassigned reads }\emph{\DIFdel{de novo}}%DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdel{. Unlike Mothur, the QIIME clustering
method uses pairwise sequence distances calculated from pairwise
sequence alignments. 
As a result, the QIIME pairwise distances are
calculated using the full \textasciitilde{}436 bp sequences whereas
Mothur pairwise distances were calculated using a 270 bp multiple
sequence alignment.
The }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{objective of any pipeline is to differentiate true biological sequences from measurement process artifacts along with accurate abundance estimates.
Our qualitative assessment results, when combined with sparsity information provides a
new method for evaluating how well bioinformatic pipelines account for sequencing artifacts without loss of true biological sequences.

\DIFadd{The qualitative assessment evaluates if titration- and unmixed-specific features can be explained by random sampling alone (Fig. \ref{fig:assessmentFramework}B).
Titration- and unmixed-specific features not explained by sampling are artifacts of the measurement process.

While microbial abundance distributions are known to have long tails, it

These limitations are described below along with
recommendations for addressing them in future studies.

Differences in the proportion of prokaryotic DNA in the samples used to
generate the two-sample titrations series resulted in differences
between the true mixture proportions and mixture design. We attempted to
account for differences in mixture proportion from mixture design by
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{estimating mixture proportions }\DIFdelend using sequence data \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{. Similar to how the

\cite{parsons2015using}. We used an assay targeting the 16S rRNA gene
to detect changes in the concentration of prokaryotic DNA across
titrations, but were unable to quantify the proportion of prokaryotic
DNA in the unmixed samples using qPCR data. Using the 16S \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{sequencing
data }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{rRNA sequencing
data, }\DIFaddend we inferred the proportion of prokaryotic DNA from the POST sample
in each titration. However, the uncertainty and accuracy of the
inference method are not known\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend resulting in an unaccounted for \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{error

A better method for quantifying sample prokaryotic DNA proportion or
using samples with consistent proportions would increase confidence in
the expected value and\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend in-turn\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend error metric accuracy. Limitations in the
prokaryotic DNA qPCR assay's concentration precision limits the
assay'\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{ssuitability }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{s suitability }\DIFaddend for use in mixture studies. Digital PCR provides a
more precise alternative to qPCR and is, therefore, a more appropriate
method. Alternatively using samples where the majority of the DNA is
prokaryotic would minimize this issue. Mixtures of environmental samples
can also be used to assess shotgun metagenomic methods as well. As
shotgun metagenomics is not a targeted approach, differences in the
proportion of prokaryotic DNA in a sample would not impact the
assessment results in the same way as 16S rRNA marker-gene-surveys.

Using samples from a vaccine trial allowed for the use of a specific
marker with an expected response, \emph{E. coli}, during methods
development. However, the high level of similarity between the \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{PRE and POST }\DIFaddend unmixed
samples resulted in a limited number of features that could be used in
the quantitative assessment results. Using more diverse samples to
generate mixtures would address this issue.
\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Alternatively, instead of mixing PRE and POST samples from the same individual,
mixing PRE and POST samples from different individuals would
have resulted in additional features for use in our quantitative assessment.
While unmixed sample similarity impacts the number of features
that can be used in the quantitative assessment, the qualitative
assessment is not impacted by unmixed sample similarity.
Finally, a symmetric mixture design, for example one with unmixed
PRE and POST ratios of 1:4, 1:2, 1:1, 2:1, and 4:1, would provide a larger
dynamic range of abundance values for assessing both PRE and POST specific features.

Initial PCR products were purified using 0.8X AMPure XP beads (Beckman
Coulter Genomics, Danvers, MA) following the manufacturer's protocol.
After purification, the 192 samples were indexed using the Illumina
Nextera XT index kits A and D (Illumina Inc., San Diego CA) and then

\DIFdelbegin \subsubsection*{\DIFdel{Sequence Processing}}
%DIFAUXCMD
%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdelend Sequence data were processed using four bioinformatic pipelines: a
\emph{de-novo} clustering method - Mothur
\cite{schloss2009introducing}, an open-reference clustering method -
QIIME \cite{Caporaso2010}, and a sequence inference method - DADA2
\cite{callahan2016dada2}, and unclustered sequences as a control. The
code used to run the bioinformatic pipelines is available at
\url{https://github.com/nate-d-olson/mgtst_pipelines}.

The Mothur pipeline follows the developer's MiSeq SOP
\cite{schloss2009introducing, kozich2013development}. The pipeline was
run using Mothur version 1.37 (\url{http://www.mothur.org/}). We
sequenced a larger 16S rRNA region, with smaller overlap between the
forward and reverse reads, than the 16S rRNA region the SOP was
designed. Pipeline parameters modified to account for difference in
overlap are noted for individual steps below. The Makefile and scripts
used to run the Mothur pipeline are available
\url{https://github.com/nate-d-olson/mgtst_pipelines/blob/master/code/mothur}.
The Mothur pipeline includes an initial preprocessing step where the
forward and reverse reads are trimmed and filtered using base quality
scores and were merged into single contigs for each read pair. The
following parameters were used for the initial contig filtering, no
ambiguous bases, max contig length of 500 bp, and max homopolymer length
of 8 bases. For the initial read filtering and merging step, low-quality
reads were identified and filtered from the dataset based on the
presence of ambiguous bases, failure to align to the SILVA reference
database (V119, \url{https://www.arb-silva.de/}) \cite{quast2012silva},
and identification as chimeras. Prior to alignment, the SILVA reference
multiple sequence alignment was trimmed to the V3-V5 region, positions
6,388 and 25,316. Chimera filtering was performed using UChime (version
v4.2.40) without a reference database \cite{edgar2011uchime}. OTU
clustering was performed using the OptiClust algorithm with a clustering
threshold of 0.97 \cite{westcott2017opticlust}. The RDP classifier
implemented in Mothur was used for taxonomic classification against the
Mothur provided version of the RDP v9 training set
\cite{wang2007naive}.

The QIIME open-reference clustering pipeline for paired-end Illumina
data was performed according to the online tutorial (Illumina Overview
Tutorial (an IPython Notebook): open reference OTU picking and core
diversity analyses, \url{http://qiime.org/tutorials/}) using QIIME
version 1.9.1 \cite{Caporaso2010}. Briefly, the QIIME pipeline uses
fastq-join (version 1.3.1) to merge paired-end reads
\cite{aronesty2011ea} and the Usearch algorithm \cite{edgar2010search}
with Greengenes database version 13.8 with a 97\% similarity threshold
\cite{desantis2006greengenes} was used for open-reference clustering.

DADA2, an R native pipeline was also used to process the sequencing data
\cite{callahan2016dada2}. The pipeline includes a sequence inference
step and taxonomic classification using the DADA2 implementation of the
RDP naïve Bayesian classifier \cite{wang2007naive} and the SILVA
database V123 provided by the DADA2 developers
\cite[\url{https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/training.html}]{quast2012silva}.

The unclustered pipeline was based on the Mothur \emph{de-novo}
clustering pipeline, where the paired-end reads were merged, filtered,
and then dereplicated. Reads were aligned to the reference Silva
alignment (V119, \url{https://www.arb-silva.de/}), and reads failing
alignment were excluded from the dataset. Taxonomic classification of
the unclustered sequences was performed using the same RDP classifier
implemented in Mothur used for the \emph{de-novo} pipeline. To limit the
size of the dataset the most abundant 40,000 OTUs (comparable to the
Mothur dataset), across all samples, were used as the unclustered
dataset.

To provide context for the artifactual feature proportion results count table sparsity was used (Fig. \ref{fig:assessmentFramework}C).

\DIFaddend Hypothesis tests were used to determine if \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{differences in

p-values were adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini \& Hochberg method \cite{benjamini1995controlling}.
For \emph{unmixed-specific} features, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{a }\DIFaddend binomial test was used to evaluate if true feature relative abundance is less than the expected relative abundance.
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{A binomial test could not be used to evaluate }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The binomial test was infeasible for }\DIFaddend \emph{titration-specific} features\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, as the

\subsubsection*{Quantitative Assessment}
\DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdelend For quantitative assessment, we compared observed relative abundance and
log fold-changes to expected values derived from the titration
experimental design.
Feature average relative abundance across PCR
replicates was calculated using a negative binomial model, and used as
observed relative abundance values (\(obs\)) for the relative abundance
assessment. Average relative abundance values were used to reduce PCR
replicate outliers from biasing the assessment results. Equation
\eqref{eq:mixEq} and inferred \(\theta\) values were used to calculate the
expected relative abundance values (\(exp\)). Relative abundance error
rate is defined as \(|exp - obs|/exp\).
\DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdelend We developed bias and variance metrics to assess feature performance.
The feature-level bias and variance metrics were defined as the median
error rate and robust coefficient of variation (\(RCOV=IQR/median\))
respectively.
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Mixed-effects models were used to compare feature-level
error rate bias and variance metrics across pipelines with subject as a
random effect. Extreme feature-level error rate bias and variance metric
outliers were observed, these outliers were excluded from the mixed
effects model to minimize biases due to poor model fit and were
characterized independently.
}\DIFdelend 

Log fold-change between samples in the titration series including PRE
and POST were compared to the expected log fold-change values to assess
differential abundance log fold-change estimates. Log fold-change
estimates were calculated using EdgeR
\cite{Robinson2010, McCarthy2012}. Expected log fold-change for feature
\(j\) between titrations \(l\) and \(m\) is calculated using equation
\eqref{eq:expLogFC}, where \(\theta\) is the proportion of POST bacterial
DNA in a titration, and \(q\) is feature relative abundance. For
features only present in PRE samples\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend the expected log fold-change is
independent of the observed counts for the unmixed samples and is
calculated using \eqref{eq:expPreLogFC}. Features only observed in POST
samples, \emph{POST-specific}, expected log fold-change values can be
calculated in a similar manner. However, \emph{POST-specific} features
were rarely observed in more than one titration and therefore were not
suitable for use in our assessment. Due to a limited number of
\emph{PRE-specific} features, both \emph{PRE-specific} and
\emph{PRE-dominant} features were used in the differential abundance
assessment. \emph{PRE-specific} features were defined as features
observed in all four PRE PCR replicates and not observed in any of the
POST PCR replicates and \emph{PRE-dominant} features were also observed
in all four PRE PCR replicates and observed in one or more of the POST
PCR replicates with a log fold-change between PRE and POST samples
greater than 5.

\begin{equation}
      logFC_{lm,j} = \log_2\left(\frac{\theta_l q_{post,j} + (1 - \theta_l) q_{pre,i}}{\theta_m q_{post,j} + (1 - \theta_m) q_{pre,j}}\right)
  \label{eq:expLogFC}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
      logFC_{lm,i} = log_2\left(\frac{1-\theta_l}{1-\theta_m}\right)
  \label{eq:expPreLogFC}
\end{equation}

\DIFadd{Demonstrate framework by comparing the qualitative and quantitative assessment results across the three pipelines.
We first characterized overall differences in the count tables produced by the three pipelines.

\subsubsection*{\DIFadd{Qualitative Assessment}}
\DIFadd{For the qualitative assessment we compare the proportion of artifactual features.
The artifactual feature proportion was defined as the proportion of }\emph{\DIFadd{unmixed-}} \DIFadd{and }\emph{\DIFadd{titration-specific}} \DIFadd{features with abundance values that could not be explained by sampling alone.
These are PCR replicates with p-values less than 0.05 after multiple hypothesis test correction for the binomial and bayesian hypothesis tests described in the assessment framework methods section.
We additionally used the count table sparsity values to draw conclusions regarding the mechanism responsible for different artifactual feature proportions.
}

\subsubsection*{\DIFadd{Quantitative Assessment}}
\DIFadd{Mixed-effects models were used to compare feature-level
error rate bias and variance metrics across pipelines with subject as a

outliers were excluded from this analysis to minimize biases due to poor model fit. 
Features with large bias and variance metrics, \(1.5\times IQR\) from the median, were deemed outliers. 
These outlier features were characterized independently in a separate analysis. 
}

\DIFadd{We fit the following mixed effect model to test for differences in measurement bias across pipelines
}

$$
\DIFadd{e_{ijk} = b + b_i + z_j + \epsilon_{ijk}
}$$

\DIFadd{where $e_{ijk}$ is the observed error across features and tritations $k$ for pipeline $i$ on individual $j$. $b_i$ is a fixed term modeling the pipeline effect, $z_j$ is a random effect (normally distributed with mean 0) capturing overall bias differences across individuals. We fit a similar model for differences in error variance across pipelines.
}

\DIFadd{We used estimated terms $\hat{b}_i$ from the mixed effects model to test for pair-wise differences across pipelines.
These multiple comparisons were performed with Tukey's HSD test. A one-sided
alternative hypothesis was used to determine which pipelines had smaller
feature-level error rate.
